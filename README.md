# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of data science, the ability to understand and predict trends over time is a crucial skill. Time series analysis plays a pivotal role in unraveling patterns, identifying anomalies, and making informed predictions based on historical data. This Jupyter Notebook project delves into the realm of time series data, exploring various techniques for analysis and forecasting.

In this project, I analyze the monthly sales data of a medium-sized rental store business located in England
